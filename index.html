									<p>In the new world of coronavirus, multidisciplinary efforts have been organized to slow the spread of the pandemic. In order to train a custom face mask detector, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps: Training Here we’ll focus on loading our face mask detection dataset from disk, training a model (using Keras / TensorFlow) on this dataset, and then serializing the face mask detector to disk Deployment:Once the face mask detector is trained, we can then move on to loading the mask detector, performing face detection, and then classifying each face as with_mask or without_mask </p>
