									<p>A self-learning AI which incorporates machine learning and detects and Identifies faces of people and maintains a database containing information about the person. Two special features of the project. First is its self-learning capabilities, i.e. whenever a new person comes in front of the camera it asks for the person's name and automatically trains itself in order to identify that person in the future. Second is the voice interaction. User inputs data over voice and the AI responds via voice.</p>
